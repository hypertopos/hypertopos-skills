# GDS Scanner

A GDS scanner looks for anomaly types invisible to standard `find_anomalies`
and `passive_scan`: cross-pattern discrepancies, geometric neighbor
contamination, non-linear temporal trajectories, and population segment
shifts.

Each scan below targets a distinct anomaly category. Standard detection
finds entities that are anomalous — these scans find entities that are
anomalous in ways standard detection cannot see. Covering all four gives
the most complete picture; skipping one leaves that category unchecked.

## FDR control, diverse selection, and confidence filtering

Large-population scans should always set `fdr_alpha` (e.g. `fdr_alpha=0.05`) on `find_anomalies`, `attract_boundary`, `find_hubs`, and `find_drifting_entities` because the multiple-testing problem is worse at scale — without FDR control, a 100K-entity scan produces hundreds of false discoveries that contaminate downstream cross-pattern and contamination analysis. Use `select="diverse"` to surface the distinct types of anomaly present in the population rather than ranking purely by severity; this applies submodular facility location to maximize geometric coverage across the result set, which is critical when the scan feeds into segment shift or trajectory shape analysis where variety matters more than extremity.

For populations <= 50K (where bootstrap confidence is computed), add `min_confidence` as a second-pass filter after initial candidate discovery:

```
find_anomalies(pattern_id, top_n=50, fdr_alpha=0.05, select="diverse")
-> initial candidate set with FDR control

find_anomalies(pattern_id, top_n=50, fdr_alpha=0.05, min_confidence=0.7)
-> stable-anomaly subset for downstream cross-pattern and contamination analysis
```

**Storey adaptive FDR (optional, regime-dependent).** On patterns where the population carries a real null mass alongside the anomalous tail, `fdr_method="storey"` paired with `p_value_method="chi2"` recovers 10–15% additional discoveries at the same alpha. This requires both parameters together — Storey with default rank p-values collapses to plain BH because rank p-values are uniform by construction. Before using Storey, check `sphere_overview` for the pattern's anomaly_rate and look at `delta_norm` distribution: if the median delta is close to sqrt(df) (with a meaningful tail), Storey helps; if the median is much smaller than sqrt(df) (compressed) or much larger (every entity already looks anomalous), keep the default `fdr_method="bh"` — Storey will not change the result.

```
find_anomalies(pattern_id, top_n=100, fdr_alpha=0.05,
               fdr_method="storey", p_value_method="chi2")
-> adaptive FDR, more discoveries when the pattern has a real null tail
```

For mixed-type patterns (check `dimension_kinds` in sphere_overview — look for a mix of poisson/gaussian/bernoulli), try `metric="bregman"` as an alternative ranking:

```
find_anomalies(pattern_id, top_n=50, metric="bregman")
-> rank by distribution-aware Bregman divergence instead of L2 delta_norm
```

Bregman ranking scores each dimension according to its statistical kind (KL for counts, KL for binary, squared z-score for continuous). On patterns with heterogeneous dimension types, Bregman can surface anomalies that L2 misses because L2 treats all dimensions identically.

The two calls serve different purposes: the first gives full coverage, the second prunes borderline detections before expensive multi-pattern verification. Use both when the scan feeds into cross-pattern discrepancy or neighbor contamination — unstable anomalies inflate false discrepancy signals.

## Choosing which scans to run

| Sphere characteristic | Relevant scan |
|---|---|
| Entity line covered by 2+ patterns | Cross-pattern discrepancy |
| Any pattern with entities | Geometric neighbor contamination |
| Patterns with `has_temporal: true` | Temporal trajectory shape |
| Categorical properties (nation, segment, region) | Population segment shift |
| Sphere has aliases (`get_sphere_info` shows aliases) | Alias anomaly scan — **mandatory** |
| Pattern has edge table (`edge_stats` returns `has_edge_table: true`) | `contagion_score_batch` for neighbor contamination via transaction graph |

---

## Alias anomaly scan

**Mandatory.** Aliases are derived views with their own geometry — scanning
only base patterns misses alias-specific anomalies. Skipping alias coverage
is the most common cause of incomplete discovery in benchmarks.

For every alias returned by `get_sphere_info()`:

```
find_anomalies(alias_pattern, top_n=20)
attract_boundary(alias, base_pattern, direction="in")
attract_boundary(alias, base_pattern, direction="out")
```

Alias-specific anomalies often surface aggregation-level signals (e.g.,
vendor-level or segment-level deviations) invisible in entity-level base
patterns.

---

## Cross-pattern discrepancy

**What it finds:** entities anomalous in ONE pattern but NORMAL in another.
This is the OPPOSITE of multi-source confirmation (threshold=2).

For each entity line covered by 2+ patterns:

```
passive_scan(line_id, threshold=1)
```

To include near-threshold entities in the discrepancy analysis, add borderline sources:
```
passive_scan(home_line_id=line_id, sources='[
  {"type": "geometry", "pattern_id": "pattern_a"},
  {"type": "geometry", "pattern_id": "pattern_b"},
  {"type": "borderline", "pattern_id": "pattern_a", "rank_threshold": 80}
]')
```

See gds-fraud-investigator skill for full source type reference (`geometry`, `borderline`,
`points`, `compound`).

Filter results to entities with source_count=1. For each:

```
cross_pattern_profile(key, line_id)
explain_anomaly(key, pattern_id)   -> check bregman_contribution + kind per dimension
```

What you're looking for: one pattern says "anomalous", another says "normal".
Example: supplier anomalous in pricing but normal in activity. This is a DISTINCT
finding type — do not collapse with multi-source findings.

When `explain_anomaly` returns `bregman_contribution`, use `pct_of_total` to rank
the driving dimensions rather than `abs_delta`. In cross-pattern discrepancy cases,
the Bregman breakdown often reveals that a bernoulli or poisson dimension carries
the anomaly signal in one pattern while gaussian dims dominate the other — this
dimension-kind mismatch explains WHY the two patterns diverge on the same entity.

**Common mistake:** using threshold=2 (finds agreement). Here you need threshold=1
(finds discrepancy).

**Complementary:** For spheres with clear cluster structure, `cluster_bridges(pattern_id)` surfaces entities that straddle cluster boundaries — these often manifest as cross-pattern discrepancies (anomalous in one cluster's context, normal in another's).

## Geometric neighbor contamination

**What it finds:** normal entities whose geometric neighbors are systematically
anomalous. The target is NORMAL — invisible to any anomaly scan.

> **Prefer (in order):** (1) `detect_neighbor_contamination` — inverted search, most effective.
> (2) `contagion_score_batch(candidate_keys, pattern_id)` — if edge table available, computes
> exact anomalous/total neighbor ratio via transaction graph. (3) Manual recipe below — fallback.
>
> **As-of retrospective scan:** `contagion_score_batch` (and the other five
> edge-table graph primitives) accepts an optional `timestamp_cutoff` parameter
> (Unix seconds). Use it to re-run the scan as the graph looked on a prior date —
> useful for validating new detection recipes against historical snapshots without
> reopening the sphere at a different manifest version.

**Manual recipe** (fallback): run `find_similar_entities` on at least 10 entities
(5 anomalous + 5 normal).

**From anomalous entities:**

```
For 5 anomalous entities from find_anomalies:
  find_similar_entities(entity_key, pattern, top_n=10)
  check_anomaly_batch([neighbor_keys], pattern)
If a NORMAL neighbor has >50% anomalous neighbors, it is a contamination target.
```

**From normal entities:**

```
For 5 normal entities (delta_rank_pct 30-70):
  find_similar_entities(normal_key, pattern, top_n=10)
  check_anomaly_batch([neighbor_keys], pattern)
```

Contamination targets are by definition normal — you won't find them
by only checking anomalous entities. Check both directions.

## Temporal trajectory shape

**What it finds:** entities with non-linear temporal trajectories (arch,
V-shape, spike-recovery) that have near-zero displacement — invisible
to top-N drift ranking.

> **Prefer `detect_trajectory_anomaly`** — it performs a full temporal scan,
> streaming all temporal data and classifying every entity's trajectory shape.
> It ranks results by `wasted_motion` (path_length - displacement), which directly
> targets non-linear trajectories. No need to manually probe at multiple displacement
> rank offsets. The `displacement_ranks` parameter is deprecated/ignored; use
> `top_n_per_range` as a total results cap. Use the manual recipe only if `detect_*`
> tools are unavailable.

**Manual recipe** (fallback): run `dive_solid` on entities from DIFFERENT
displacement ranges — not just top-10 or mid-rank. Check at least one entity
from each range:
- Top-5 displacement (likely linear drift)
- Rank 20-50 (moderate — may be non-linear)
- Rank 100-200 (low displacement — arch/V candidates hide here)

```
dive_solid(entity_key, pattern)
```

Inspect delta values across slices:
- Monotonic increase = linear drift (already caught by drift detection)
- Up-then-down (arch) or down-then-up (V) = trajectory anomaly
- Flat = no signal (move to next range)

**If flat at rank 20-50, check rank 100-200 before concluding.**
Arch trajectories can have very low displacement.

If arch/V-shape found:

```
find_drifting_similar(entity_key, pattern, top_n=20)
```

This recovers the full cohort sharing the same trajectory shape.

Key insight: linear drift has HIGH displacement. Non-linear trajectories
have NEAR-ZERO displacement — they cancel out over time. Searching lower
displacement ranges is the only way to find them.

## Population segment shift

**What it finds:** a specific segment (nation, category, region) that shifted
collectively — individual entities below theta, group centroid moved significantly.

Run after every `find_regime_changes` detection. Do not dismiss a regime change
as "data boundary" without segment analysis first.

```
get_line_schema(entity_line)  -> find categorical properties
```

For each categorical property with <50 distinct values:

```
find_anomalies(pattern, property_filters={"<prop>": "<value>"}, limit=50)
```

Compare anomaly counts per segment value. The segment with disproportionately
more anomalies = affected group.

**When you find the affected segment, list ALL entity keys in it:**

```
search_entities(entity_line, "<prop>", "<segment_value>")
```

These are ALL entities in the shifted segment — include the full key list
in the report. Do not just say "GERMANY shifted" — list every entity.

**Common mistake:** detect regime change, attribute to data boundary, move on.
Decompose by segment before dismissing.

## When things don't work

- **Tool returns empty results** — try different parameters, wider sample,
  or a different pattern. Not all spheres have the data shape these scans expect.
- **Tool errors** — check pattern_id and version, verify sphere is open.
  If the error persists, report it rather than retrying in a loop.
- **No anomalies found** — not every sphere has every anomaly type.
  Report "no signal detected for this scan type" as a valid finding.
- **passive_scan returns 0 results at threshold=1** — the entity line may
  be covered by only one pattern. Cross-pattern discrepancy requires 2+ patterns.
- **find_similar_entities returns few neighbors** — small population or
  extreme outlier. Reduce `top_n` or try a different pattern.
- **dive_solid returns no temporal slices** — the pattern lacks temporal data.
  Skip trajectory shape analysis and note it in the report.
